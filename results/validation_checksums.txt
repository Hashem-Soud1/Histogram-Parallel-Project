1. Pixel Count Check via Histogram Sum
To verify the correctness of the histogram computation, the sum of all histogram values (for grayscale levels 0–255)
was compared to the total number of pixels in the image.

 histogram[i]=Image Width × Image Height

This validation ensures that each pixel in the image was counted exactly once.

Example: For a 512×512 image, expected total pixels = 262,144

Validation Result: Passed — Sum matched expected total 




2. The correctness of the testHistogramSum() function was also verified using
 AI tools (ChatGPT) to ensure the logic was sound.

The sum obtained from the sequential histogram implementation was used as a reference to validate
the correctness of the parallel implementation.

Both results were compared and found to be identical, 
confirming the consistency of the histogram calculation across both methods.
